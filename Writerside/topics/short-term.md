# Short Term
Anticipated release within 2 - 3 months.

## Scenarios
In the current version, one Test Configuration only manages a single test.

We will shortly be adding the ability to define multiple scenarios within one Test Configuration.

This will enable you to manage similar and related tests in one place without an unnecessary proliferation of Test Configurations that can be harder to keep track of.

## Mocking
It is already possible to handle mocking as [explained here](C-I10-mocking.md).

We will make it fully UI supported to avoid the need to write your own mocking methods.

# API Testing
The high level concept is [described here](api-testing.md).

## Standalone Part 2
Extending Standalone Part 1 to Java.
