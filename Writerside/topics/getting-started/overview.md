# Overview
Vizitest runs on a local development machine. It never sends anything into the Cloud.

Below are a few observations that you should be aware of.

- Vizitest is currently available for Java only. However, we will be adding C# shortly and next year we will also be adding C/C++, Typescript and Python.
- It is currently installed as a simple IntelliJ plugin that runs the main Vizitest service. We will soon be removing the requirement for an IntelliJ plugin, so it can run independently of any IDE.
- The front-end runs in a browser. You can choose to run it inside an IntelliJ tab, or you can open it in a regular browser.
- You can connect Vizitest to any codebase on your local machine from the Test Manager.
- Vizitest stores its data within your codebase and is Git compatible.
