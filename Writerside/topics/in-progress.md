# In Progress

## Beta stability
Our main focus at the moment is to ensure that features available in the Beta are solid and reliable.

To help us achieve this, we will need as much feedback as possible from our users.

We aim to offer as many ways of reaching us as possible to suit everyone. Please see the Contacting Us page for details.

## Generics
Support for Generic types

## Set Class properties
The ability to access and set Class properties 

- from a Representative Value when instantiating a class
- from the Side Effects output by checking class property.

## Scenarios
In the current version, one Test Configuration only manages a single test.

We will shortly be adding the ability to define multiple scenarios within one Test Configuration.

This will enable you to manage similar and related tests in one place without an unnecessary proliferation of Test Configurations that can be harder to keep track of.
