# Dragging Groups
You can drag a Group around the canvas. To do this, the mouse needs to be positioned anywhere within the Group title of description. You can drag even if the mouse cursor shows as a text cursor.

You can also multi-select groups for dragging. To do this, press the Shift key before moving the mouse.
