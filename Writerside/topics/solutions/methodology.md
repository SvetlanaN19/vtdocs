# The Methodology problem

>*”TDD, BDD, White Box Testing, Black Box Testing, Gray Box Testing, Coding Standards. Where on earth do I start and, more importantly, where and with what do I finish? ”*

## The Problem
Product teams usually crave structure and clear frameworks within which to operate. Unfortunately there are so many opinions and approaches that it can be confusing to know what to adopt.

Often, adopting a single methodology is a straightjacket, within which you will be forced to operate for a long time.

Also, adopting these methodologies may come naturally to some and be horrible for others.

## The Solution? Pragmatism.
People love to proselytize when it comes to methodologies, often becoming dogmatic rather than looking to simply raise quality levels. The problem with dogma is that it tends to exclude other approaches.

The only thing we proselytize is quality. We are not saying that Vizitest is the only way to go, either. 

Our goal is for Vizitest to tackle 80% - 90% of your unit and integration tests. This will 

- leave you with a much smaller problem to solve
- improve your product quality
- save you considerable cost
- let you address the remaining tests by writing hand-coded tests.

You should also bear in mind that it can be expedient to not write any tests for some methods. Prioritizing Writing tests based on a simple risk analysis will at least raise your quality bar incrementally rather than an all-or-nothing approach.

In summary, a pragmatic but quality oriented approach to testing is better than no testing or poor quality tests.
