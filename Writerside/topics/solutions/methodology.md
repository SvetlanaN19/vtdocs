# The Methodology problem

>*”TDD, BDD, White Box Testing, Black Box Testing, Gray Box Testing, Coding Standards. I'm struggling to know what I should and should not adopt and in what order to adopt them!”*

## The Problem
Product teams like structure and clear frameworks within which to operate. Unfortunately there are so many opinions and approaches that it can be confusing to know what to adopt.

Often, adopting a single methodology is a straightjacket, within which you will be forced to operate for a long time.

Also, adopting these methodologies may come naturally to some and be a serious challenge for others.

## The Solution

Pragmatism.

People tend to be dogmatic about methodologies rather than looking to raise quality levels in ways that are incrementally adoptable and pragmatic.

Our goal is for Vizitest to tackle 80% - 90% of your unit and integration tests within a methodological framework or in relative isolation. This will 

- introduce testing incrementally and practically
- improve product quality
- save cost
- still let you write hand-coded tests whenever you want to.

You should also bear in mind that it can be expedient to not write any tests for some methods. Prioritizing Writing tests based on a simple risk analysis will at least raise your quality bar incrementally rather than an all-or-nothing approach.

In summary, a pragmatic approach to testing is better than no testing at all or writing poor quality tests that are abandoned as soon as they slow you down.
