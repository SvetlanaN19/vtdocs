# The Readability problem
>*"This test used to work but the requirements changed and now it doesn't. It's really tough to figure out what the test is actually doing and how to modify it."*

>*"The developer who wrote the test left the company. It's tough to figure out what's going on."*

## The Problem

Hand coded tests, even written with care and attention, might make sense while they're fresh in the mind. But come back to look at it in 6 months, and it's suddenly mysterious and take an age to decipher. This problem is compounded when read by someone other than the person who write the test.

## The Solution
Vizitest's canvas based approach is highly visual and makes it easy not just for developers but also for QA's and Product Owners to understand.

Rather than reading through tens or hundreds of lines of code, you can see the whole picture, literally, on the canvas.
