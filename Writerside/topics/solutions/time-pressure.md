# The Time Pressure problem

>*”Why do we never have time to do it right, but always have time to do it over?”*

## The Problem
Adopting testing requires serious discipline on many levels. 

The fact is all teams are under pressure to deliver product to a specific deadline. And usually, the deadline takes priority over quality.

So time after time, compromises are made

- unit and integration tests are written in a hurry
- or not at all
- problematic tests are removed rather than fixed

## The Solution
The [Vizitest in a nutshell video](nutshell.md) explains a lot about what we do and how we try to make the impractical, practical and, in some cases, we'd like to think the impossible, possible.

- It's both fast and easy to write quality unit and integration tests.
- A lot of tests can be written by technical QAs.
- It's easy to see what's going on, long after the person who wrote the test has left the company.
- We auto-generate both test cases and the test code.
