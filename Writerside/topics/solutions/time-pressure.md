# The Time Pressure problem

>*”Why do we never have time to do it right, but always have time to do it over?”*

## The Problem
In the short term, adopting testing takes discipline and time. 

The fact is, all teams are under pressure to deliver product to deadlines. And usually, the deadline takes priority over quality.

So time after time, compromises are made

- unit and integration tests are written in a hurry
- or not at all
- problematic tests are removed rather than fixed.

## The Solution
The [Vizitest in a nutshell video](nutshell.md) explains a lot about what we do and how we try to make the impractical practical.

- It's both fast and easy to write quality unit and integration tests.
- A lot of tests can be written by technical QAs.
- It's easy to see what's going on, long after the person who wrote the test has left the company.
- We auto-generate both test cases and the test code leading to consistency, reliability and a reduction in debugging.
