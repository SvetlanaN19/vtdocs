# Scenarios
In the current version, one Test Configuration only manages a single test.

We will shortly be adding the ability to define multiple scenarios within one Test Configuration.

This will enable you to manage similar and related tests in one place without an unnecessary profileration of Test Configurations that can be harder to keep track of.
