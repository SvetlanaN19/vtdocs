# Training

All materials in this section are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vizitest/training-java).

We suggest you clone this repo and then work your way through each example.

It starts off with the absolute basics and works its way up the complexity ladder. By the end, you will hopefully have mastered Vizitest and can start testing with confidence.
