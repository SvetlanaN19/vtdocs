# Arrays, Lists and Enums
**Unit B-B70** / **Repo folder : B_B70_ArrayListEnum** 

## Prep
- Find and open the training code **B_B70_ArrayListEnum** you [cloned from GitHub](github-repo.md).
- Examine the code to see what it's doing.
- In the Test Manager, [create a new Test Configuration](test-config-add.md) called **Array, List, Enum**. 
- Open the new Test Configuration.

## Task
This is a simple task. The ```setValues()``` method just takes three parameters - an Array, a List and an Enum. It doesn't do anything other than return as we just want to demonstrate how to set these values.

1. Create a Method component to test the ```setValues()``` method.
2. Create an Equivalence Class with a single Representative Value.
3. For each parameter, set some data to pass in for each of the types.

[TODO - need to see this in action and check above]
