# Chained Methods
**Unit C-I50** / **Repo folder : C_I40_MultipleMethods** 

Two methods are chained if the output of Method A is used as an input to Method B.

## Prep
- Find and open the training code C_I40_MultipleMethods you [cloned from GitHub](github-repo.md).
- In the Test Manager, clone the  **Multiple Methods** Test Configuration we created in the [previous unit](C-I40-multiple-methods.md) and name it **Chained Methods**. 
- Open the new Test Configuration.


## Task
We want to take the output from the first Method Component, which multiplies a number, and use that as the ```divisor``` parameter for the second parameter. We would expect to get ```1``` as the output.

[TODO - need to see it working to complete]
