# More on Exceptions
**Unit C-I20**

This unit just draws your attention to how exceptions are managed in Vizitest.

If your code throws exceptions you can handle the general **Exception** as well as custom exceptions.

In the Method component's Output column, you have the **Exceptions** section. For each exception you have added to the list you can change the expected exception type using the dropdown.

If you code only throws custom exceptions, you can use the general **Exception** alone, which will catch all exceptions including custom ones.
