# Create a Test Configuration
Test Configurations are where your actual unit and integration tests are configured.

## Create the Test Configuration
- Assuming you've completed the [Creating and labelling Groups](A-TM20-groups.md), go ahead and create a Test Configuration called **Water State** in the **Unit Tests** Group as [explained here](test-config-add.md).
- If you haven't add it to any Group you choose.

You should now see your new Test Configuration in the Group.
