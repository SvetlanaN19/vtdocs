# Connecting to the codebase
The first thing you want to do is to connect to the training codebase.

Start Vizitest and then head to the **Projects** list in the left sidebar.

- [Add a new Project](connect-codebase.md) and connect it to the training repo you should already have cloned to your local PC. 
- Set the Project name to **Training** although it's not the end of the world if you choose a different name.

You should now have a new Project in the list and a single Group created on the canvas.
