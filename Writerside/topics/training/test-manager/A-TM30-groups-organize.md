In this unit we will cover

- Dragging
- Panning
- Multi select
- Zooming
- Fit
- Auto layout
- Undo/Redo

Go ahead and mess up any neat layout you may have while working through this unit. We will cover tidying at the end.

## Dragging
You can drag a Group around the canvas. The drag grab area is anywhere within the title and description portion of the Group.

## Panning
You can pan around the canvas with **click+drag**.

## Multi select
You can multi select Groups using **shift+drag**. You can then drag the selected Groups.

## Zooming
You can zoom using your keypad, mouse-wheel or using the zoom buttons on the right side of the canvas.

## Fit
<img src="fit-button.png" alt="fit" width="30px"/>

The Fit button (right side of canvas) fits all Groups on the canvas within the viewport.

## Auto layout
<img src="auto-layout-button.png" alt="auto layout" width="30px"/>

This button tidies up the Groups by organizing them in the best way it can. Don't like it? Press Undo.

## Undo/Redo
This support most canvas actions using either the buttons on the left side of the canvas or with the standard hotkey combination.

Some major actions, like deleting a Group, cannot be undone, so be careful. Such actions require a confirmation word to be entered to hopefully save you from unintentional deletions.
