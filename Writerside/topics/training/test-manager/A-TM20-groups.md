# Creating and labelling Groups

## Groups
We'll now add some Groups beneath the top Group. 

Add some Groups as [explained here](group-add-organize.md) so you have a layout that looks similar to the screenshot below. User both approaches (Add Subgroup and manually connecting) for creating your Groups.

## Labelling
Change the Group titles to match by clicking in the title of each Group. 

You can also set a description if you like, although it's only cosmetic, so feel free to skip.
